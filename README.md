<h2> What have I learned </h2>

<li> I've improved my flexbox skills </li>
<li> I've further improved my ability to use basic JavaScript skills to add functionality </li>
<li> I've improved my ability to deal with small bugs and frustrating issues that come my way while programming </li>
<li> I've continued to use pseudo code to solve problems and issues </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. I moved onto the CSS, and started by importing fonts, and adding a background color for the entire webpage. Next, I started to design the card, and spent some time trying to get the small details right (such as padding, margins, font sizes etc). I then moved to styling elements like text, images, and finally some hover effects for the buttons. Furthermore, I spent some time playing around with the colors trying to find one as close as possible. I used knowledge from prior projects and applied it to this one to achieve the design I was looking for. Overall, this project allowed me to learn some new things and further improve my vanilla JS skills. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple browsers and used the built-in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. </p>
